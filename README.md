# Space Exploration Service

The Space Exploration Service provides backend functionality for querying and processing data related to space exploration missions. It utilizes FastAPI to expose endpoints that interact with the persistence service for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Overview

The Space Exploration Service acts as the backend engine, serving data via HTTP endpoints to the frontend UI. It connects to the Persistence Service for GraphQL-based data operations and management.

## Running Locally

To run the Space Exploration Service locally, you'll need to set it up alongside the Space Exploration Persistence Service and the Space Exploration UI.
